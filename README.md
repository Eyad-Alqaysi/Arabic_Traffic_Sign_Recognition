# Arabic Traffic Sign Recognition
## Overview
This paper presents a significant advancement in the field of Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR), with a focus on Arabic traffic signs. It is a collaborative effort by Eyad Alqaysi, Waleed Alsarhani, Abdulmajeed Alsharafi, and Mohammed Alzahrani, aiming to enhance the capabilities of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles through accurate, real-time recognition of traffic signs. The research employs advanced deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers, to develop a model that achieves remarkable accuracy in recognizing traffic signs under various conditions.

## Key Contributions
High Accuracy: The model demonstrates exceptional performance with an accuracy of 99.75%, setting a new benchmark in the field of TSR, particularly for Arabic traffic signs.
Advanced Techniques: Utilization of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers, optimized for the complex task of traffic sign recognition.
Robust Dataset: Training on an extensive dataset comprising 2,718 real images and 57,078 augmented images of Arabic traffic signs, collected from Eastern Saudi Arabia, ensuring the model's reliability and adaptability.
## Methodology
The research introduces a novel approach using the MobileViTv2 architecture, enhanced with a custom-designed Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). This strategic enhancement aims to augment the architectureâ€™s ability to precisely recognize and interpret Arabic traffic signs, addressing the unique challenges posed by the Arabic script and regional traffic sign variations.

## Dataset and Experiments
The study employs a comprehensive dataset of Arabic traffic signs for model training and validation. The dataset includes a diverse collection of traffic signs captured under various environmental conditions, ensuring the model's robustness. Comparative experiments with established TSR methods highlight the proposed model's superior performance.

## Conclusion
The paper concludes that the proposed model significantly advances Arabic Traffic Sign Recognition, offering potential applications in autonomous driving and intelligent traffic management systems. The high accuracy and robustness of the model underscore its potential to enhance road safety and navigation in Arabic-speaking regions.
