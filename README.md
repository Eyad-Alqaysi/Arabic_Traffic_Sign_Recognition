# Arabic Traffic Sign Recognition
Traffic Sign Recognition Project This repository contains the implementation of our traffic sign recognition method, including Jupyter notebooks for demonstration, training scripts, and configuration files. It's designed to provide a comprehensive overview of our approach to recognizing traffic signs using machine learning techniques.

Project Structure:

.ipynb_checkpoints/ - Directory for Jupyter notebook autosave files (not tracked).

models/ - Contains saved models and weights.

.gitattributes - Git configuration file for handling file types across different platforms.

TSR_our_method.ipynb - Jupyter notebook demonstrating our method for traffic sign recognition.

TSR_our_method_with_template.ipynb - A template notebook for applying our method with custom data.

combined_training_validation.png - Visualization of training and validation accuracy and loss.

conf.ipynb - Configuration notebook with parameters and settings for the recognition method.

final_test.txt - Contains final testing dataset details or results.

test_data.py - Script for preparing and loading the test data.

train.py - Main training script for the traffic sign recognition model.

train_data.py - Script for preparing and loading the training data.

val_data.py - Script for preparing and loading the validation data.

Setup:

To get started with this project, clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-sign-recognition.git

cd traffic-sign-recognition

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. While the specific requirements may vary, a typical setup might look like this:

pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter tensorflow keras

Usage:

To explore our traffic sign recognition method, start with the TSR_our_method.ipynb Jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook TSR_our_method.ipynb

For training the model with your data, run:

python train.py
